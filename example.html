 	<p>For those of us that grew up with the characters in the books and movies, visiting The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a dream come true. But, even if you don’t count yourself a fan of the books or the movies, Universal’s tribute to the world of Harry Potter is an incredible experience</p>
 	<p>There are two WWoHP parks, one in Orlando and one in Hollywood. Choose the best one for you (or go to both– like me!) and live out your most magical dreams!</p>
 	<p>Here’s the Muggle’s Guide to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter!</p>

	<p>Depending on your level of Harry Potter fandom, you might be swayed to visit one park over the other. While there are some similarities, they are quite different.</p>
	<p>Here’s a quick guide on what you can expect at Universal Orlando and Universal Hollywood to help you decide which park is right for you.</p>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h2>Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Size:</b> You’ll find both Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade Village at Universal Orlando– split between two parks. Diagon Alley is at Universal Studios and Hogsmeade Village is at Islands of Adventure. Truth be told, you likely won’t be able to see and do everything in a single day. It’s a good idea to get a multi-pass ticket or an express pass that will let you skip the long lines.</li>

		<li><b>Rides:</b> There are quite a few Harry Potter rides to enjoy in Orlando! Make sure you try: Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts, Flight of the Hippogriff, and Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey.Hogwarts Express Train: You’ll only find the Hogwarts Express train in Orlando. Travel from King’s Cross Station in London at Universal Studios Orlando to Hogsmeade Village Station at Universal’s Islands of Adventure.</li>

		<li><b>Hogwarts Express Train:</b> You’ll only find the Hogwarts Express train in Orlando. Travel from King’s Cross Station in London at Universal Studios Orlando to Hogsmeade Village Station at Universal’s Islands of Adventure.</li>
		<li><b>The Knight Bus:</b> One of my favorite features found only in Orlando is the Knight Bus! You can peek inside for all of the expected bits and bobs– including the talking shrunken head.</li>
	</ol>
	<br>

	<h2>Tips for Your First Visit to Diagon Alley</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><i> Grab lunch at The Leaky Cauldron:</i> 
			<br>
			<img src="Leaky_Cauldron.jpg" alt="">
			<p>I was incredibly impressed with the quality of food at Universal Parks and especially at the Leaky Cauldron. They make their bread fresh daily and even import food from the UK for authenticity.</p>
		</li>
		<br>
		<br>
		<li><i>Of course, don’t forget to try Butterbeer!</i> 
			<br>
			<img src="ButterBeer.jpg" alt="">
			<p>You can try it at both parks in Orlando. But, if you’re up for it, try all four ways it’s served in Diagon Alley: cold, frozen, hot or as ice cream! (PS it’s non-alcoholic so kids can enjoy too!</p></li>
		<br>
		<li><i>Get an Interactive Wand:</i> 
			<br>
			<img src="Wans.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Interact with all kinds of shop windows and props throughout both parks. You can make fountains squirt water, turn lights on and off in shop windows and even try the “Wingardium Leviosa” spell to float a feather. It’s a ton of fun for both kids and adults!</p>
		</li>

	<h2>Helpful Tip for WWoHP Orlando: Be Prepared!</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<div>
				<h3>&emsp; At the park: </h3>
				<p>Take heed—both Escape from Gringotts and Ollivanders Wand Shop are extremely popular, and lines can be long, so be prepared to wait 2+ hours on crowded days.</p>
				<p>WWoHP in Orlando is immensely popular, so plan ahead and arrive at least 15-30 minutes ahead of the park opening time.</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div>
				<h3>&emsp; Before the park:</h3>
				<p>It's always best if you look into your favorite rides beforehand. As they say <q>Always have a backup plan</q></p>
				<p>Look into this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizarding_World_of_Harry_Potter" target="_blank">site</a> for more info!</p>
